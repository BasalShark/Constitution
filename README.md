## Setting up to edit the Constitution

This set-up is a little confusing for those who have never used GitHub before, so if you get stuck - ask one of the committee! You only need to do this ONCE.

1. First of all, you'll need a GitHub account, so sign up and login.
2. Click [here](https://github.com/EdinburghUniversityCurlingClub/Constitution/fork) to fork the repository. A repository is the name given to the collection of files in a GitHub project. Forking is where you create an identical copy to your own profile, so that you can edit it. Make sure 'Copy the main branch only' is ticked, and press Create Fork!
3. You know have a local copy of the repo. It's got 2 files in currently - constitution.md and README.md. The README.md is what you're reading now. The constitution.md is our beloved document.

## Editing the Constitution

To edit the constitution, you need to edit your own copy, and then send over your changes for us (admins) to review!

1. If you can see a message saying 'This fork is ___ commits behind ______' then click the text to pull changes. If it says that you're up-to-date, great!
2. Click on the constitution.md file, and then press the pencil icon in the top-right. This is Edit Mode :). It is written in a syntax called Markdown. Basically you can just type normally, but you can style your text easily (try putting a # or a * in front of a word...).
2. Make any changes you want to the file. To save your changes, go to the bottom of the page, and fill in the box. Just write a few words stating what you did (i.e. Update Treasurer role) and press Commit Changes.
3. Feel free to keep editing and saving until you want to send it to us!
